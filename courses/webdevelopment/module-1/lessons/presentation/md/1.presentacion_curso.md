# Software Engineering Principles

## Learning Goals

After this learning unit, you will be able to:

- Understand why you should follow good practices when writing code
- Understand which are the pros and cons of writing good code
- Understand which are the most important Software Engineering Principles

## Introduction

> **“A team is only as strong as it's weakest link.”**
> *― Mark Grey*

If you are working in software development, the previous statement is more important than ever. Nowadays it's very common to work in small teams to create software based products.

Software Engineering Principles have a huge importance in development teams. Following these principles, you will be able to let your team mates understand your code easily.

It's very common to write [*spaghetti code*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaghetti_code) to go faster, only to find at some point in the future, that you look at the code and have no idea at all what it does!

Read these principles carefully, and try to apply all of them from now on in your software.

**Your workmates, and yourself, will thank you!!**

## DRY | Don't Repeat Yourself

[Don't Repeat Yourself](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_repeat_yourself) is one of the first good practices we have to follow when writing code. This principle is stated as:

> "Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system"

The DRY principle aims you to reduce the repetition of information of all kinds: database schemas, test plans, documentation, code...

The most important thing for us is to **avoid code repetition**. You should not keep duplicated code in your codebase. Let's elaborate an example to see why it's so important:

Let's suppose we have an online shop website with two different sections:

- Simple search
- Advanced search

While the simple search let us search a product, the advanced search let us search a product, but we can also filter by product category.

- A junior developer may implement these two functionalities as separate functions
- A more experienced developer will quickly identify that Advanced Search is a superset of the simple search, and will make sure that the code for advanced search uses the simple search logic.
- A Senior developer will separate the logic for search into a reusable component and will instantiate each component to use what they need, but having the logic in a central class.

:::info
Let's assume we don't reuse the code and we find a [bug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bug) when we search a product by name. We will have to correct it twice!?**
:::

## KISS | Keep It Simple Stupid

> Most systems work best if they are kept simple rather than making them complex; therefore simplicity should be a key goal in design and unnecessary complexity should be avoided.
> [Kelly Johson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_Johnson_(engineer))

The simpler your code is, the simpler it will be to maintain it in the future and, of course, the simpler it will be to understand it.

This is very important when you are working in a team of developers. The other team members should be able to understand the code without asking you anything.

A good advice is to avoid using fancy features from the programming language just because they are there. You should use them only when it's necessary and you can get a perceptible benefits to the problem you are solving.

Another interesting perspective on the product management side, is to ensure every feature we add is as simple as it can be. Steve Krug's classic on usability: ["Don't make me think"](https://www.amazon.com/Dont-Make-Think-Revisited-Usability/dp/0321965515) explores this idea in depth:

![](https://i.imgur.com/RhQgiWu.png)

## YAGNI | You aren't gonna need it

> "It seems that perfection is attained, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing more to take away"
> [Antoine de Saint Exupéry](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Antoine_de_Saint_Exup%C3%A9ry)

Sometimes we try to think too much in the future of the project. That encourages us to code some extra features "just in case we need them". We can avoid this by asking us: **is it necessary?**

YAGNI is a principle of [extreme programming](http://www.extremeprogramming.org/) that states a programmer should not add functionality until it is really needed. It will help you to keep your code clean and simple.

In extreme programming, this practice is known as **do the simplest thing that could possibly work**. You should not waste your time coding features that maybe you will never need.

The advantages of applying YAGNI in your next project are:
- The time is spent on adding, testing or improving **necessary functionality**
- Less code bloat; software becomes smaller and less complicated
- Adding a new feature may suggest new features; This can snoball into feature creep! The more you have, the more you want.

## KISS + YAGNI = :heart:

Combining KISS (Keep it Stupid Simple) and YAGNI (You aren't gonna need it) Principles, we can make sure that we build much better software.

## SOLID Principles

SOLID Principles are the first five principles that stands for five basic principles of object-oriented programming and design. The intention is that these principles applied all together will help you creating a system that is easy to mantain and extend over the time. It is composed by five principles:

- Single Responsability Principle
- Open/Closed Principle
- Liskov Substitution Principle
- Interface Segregation Principle
- Dependency Inversion Principle

### Single Responsability Principle

It's a concept of a Class or Method doing one specific thing (responsability) and not trying to do more than it should which is also referred to as High [Cohesion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohesion_(computer_science)):

> "In computer programming, cohesion refers to the degree to which the elements of a module belong together"

![Single Responsability Principle](https://i.imgur.com/HmkQoxU.png)

### Open/Closed Principle

In object oriented programming, a class should be open for extension, but closed for modification. What does it means?

When we are working with a class, we should be able to add new functionality to it, but we should never be able to change its behaviour.

The reason for this principle is that when we modify the behaviour, all the code that uses that class may break. Therefore, it's considered a better practice to extend a class, rather than modifying it.

### Liskov Substitution Principle

Substitutability is a principle in object-oriented programming that states that, in computer programming, if S is a subclass of C, then objects of type C may be replaced with objects of type S without altering any of the desirable properties of that program.

Suppose you have an object `Athlete` with a method `run`, and you have an object `Footballer` that inherits from `Athlete`. You should be able to substitute your `Athlete` by a `Footballer`, and the new object should be able to run as expected.

### Interface Segregation Principle

Clients should not be forced to depend on methods they do not use.

It occurs when clients are forced to implement unused methods with degenerate functionality, and it's because an object serves as an implementatino for a non-cohesive interface.

It's similar to the Single Responsability Principle in that both deal with the cohesion responsabilities.

### Dependency Inversion Principle

It relates the stability and reusability of higher-level components within an application. High modules shouldn't depend on low-level modules, and they both should depend on abstractions.

Abstractions should not depend upon details, instead details should depend upon abstractions.

## Summary

To sum up, we learnt which are the most important principles we should follow while developing software, and some of these principles are very common in extremme programming.

We also learnt that implementing these principles will help us and our team mates in the future while mantaining our code.

## JavaScript

            const JavaScript = {

                browser: ["Vanilla.js", "Angular"],
                server: "Node.js",
                mobileApps: ["Android", "iOS"],
                desk_apps: "Electron",
                ...
            }
Ventajas:

_Rendimiento_: Se compila, se optimiza y se ejecuta como código nativo en el navegador

_Objetos_: __JSON__ (JavaScript Object Notation) es un subconjunto de la notación de objetos de JavaScript

-_Reusabilidad_: El mismo código corre de forma nativa en cliente y servidor. Además es modulable y encapsulable

???
_Rendimiento_: La mayor parte del JavaScript se compila, se optimiza y se ejecuta como código nativo en el navegador. El rendimiento en tiempo de ejecución es comparable a programas escritos en C o C++. Con Node.js, las aplicaciones son además orientada a eventos y no bloqueantes.

_Objetos_: La notación __JSON__ (JavaScript Object Notation) es un subconjunto de la notación de objetos de JavaScript. JavaScript usa el modelo de herencia prototípica. En lugar de clases, se trabaja con prototipos; los nuevos objetos heredan métodos y atributos del objeto padre a través de la cadena prototípica.

-_Reusabilidad_: El mismo código corre de forma nativa en cliente y servidor. Además es modulable y encapsulable.
