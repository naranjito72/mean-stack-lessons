## Learning Goals

After this unit, you will be able to:

- Understand the structure of a HTML document, apply basic HTML tags and tag attributes to create pages.

- Understand the difference between inline and block elements.

- Use inline and block elements to create a simple webpage.

---

## HTML Introduction

__What is HTML?__
HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is a language for creating web pages and web applications. HTML special instructions are the building blocks of web pages.

A web page is a collection of many kinds of content. This might be text, graphics, forms, audio and video files, etc. These elements live inside HTML tags. The browser uses these tags to decide how to display, order and style the content on the page.

HTML files that produce web pages are simple text files. Text is a universal way of representing data for computers; any HTML you create on a Windows PC could work on a Mac, Linux/Unix, or any other operating system.

---

The best way to start working with HTML is jump right in. So let‚Äôs see a real example:

<img src="https://imgur.com/DhgcTot.png" width=50%>

Let‚Äôs take a look at the picture above. It shows a simple web page with a title, a menu, a picture and some written information.

Web browsers read and display HTML markup. This markup -with a little help of CSS, which we‚Äôll learn in the future- tells the browser how to do it.

---

In the HTML file you will find the content of the components shown below.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>The HTML5 Breakfast Site</title>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="container">
      <nav id="topnav">
        <a href="index.html">HOME</a> | <a href="about.html">ABOUT US</a> |
        <a href="menu.html">MENU</a> |
        <a href="contact.html">CONTACT US</a>
      </nav>
      <div id="content">
        <h1>The good breakfast</h1>
        <!-- Insert your preformated text here -->
        <p>Here you will find all sorts of delicious treats</p>
        <figure>
          <img
            src="https://i.postimg.cc/htxcJGB6/ZKkCecn.jpg"
            width="400"
            alt="breakfast"
          />
          <figcaption>powered by biscuit.</figcaption>
        </figure>
      </div>
      <!-- Insert paragraph here -->
      <!-- Insert your menu here -->
      <!-- Insert your reservations form here -->
      <footer>
        <p class="love">From the oven with love</p>
      </footer>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
```
---

### Ejercicio
<hr>

Try to locate these components in the HTML Code and in the picture:

__Title__: The HTML5 Breakfast Site

__Navigation Bar__: (HOME | ABOUT US | MENU | CONTACT US)

__The breakfast Image__

__The signature of the webpage creators__

Can you find them all?

## HTML DOM tree

Every HTML Document can be represented as a tree using the Document Object Model (DOM), which contains all the elements of the HTML document, their format and the browser state at a specific moment.

The DOM structure is usually represented as a tree of nodes, where we can see what nodes (such as `<html>`) have which other nodes inside, for example `<head>`.

![](https://imgur.com/xUuFDVD.png)

In the HTML DOM, everything is a node. The document is a document node. But the elements, attributes and the content inside de elements are nodes, too. We will learn about this in further lessons.

---

Now let‚Äôs take a look at the code in the given example and let‚Äôs explain some of the syntax:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html> 
<html>
  <head>
	<title>My first document</title>
	<meta charset="UTF-8">
  </head>
  <body>
	...
  </body>
</html>
```

__`<!DOCTYPE html>`__: <span style="font-size:14px"> Indicates that the markup language for your document content is HTML5.</span>

__`<html>`__:<span style="font-size:14px"> The root of an HTML document. All other elements must be descendants of this element.

__`<head>`__:<span style="font-size:14px"> Defines an element that provides general information (metadata) about the document, including its title and links to its scripts and style sheets. Usually it contains:

__`<title>`__:<span style="font-size:14px"> The title of the document. It is shown in a browser‚Äôs title bar or on the page‚Äôs tab.

__`<meta>`__:<span style="font-size:14px"> This includes information about styles, scripts and data to help browsers use and render the page. One of the most commons elements is the `<meta charset="UTF-8">` in our example. This specifies the character encoding for the HTML document as UTF-8.

__`<body>`__:<span style="font-size:14px"> contains all the content of an HTML document. Every HTML component should be written between the opening and the closing body tag. As there can be only one entire body in a document, there can be only one `<body>` element.

---

## ‚ÄúBlock‚Äù Vs ‚ÄúInline‚Äù

<p style="background-color:palegoldenrod">This is one of those concepts that we really encourage you to understand correctly. It can help you to take your HTML and CSS skills to the next level.</p>

Within the `<body>` element, we will write all the elements that we want to display in our website. These elements will be either block-elements or inline-elements.

We‚Äôll be discussing this in more detail, but check out this example on CodePen for clarification:

<iframe height="265" style="width: 100%;" scrolling="no" title="JavaScript - Block vs Inline" src="https://codepen.io/rglepe/embed/KKpKRxj?height=265&theme-id=default&default-tab=html,result" frameborder="no" allowtransparency="true" allowfullscreen="true">
  See the Pen <a href='https://codepen.io/rglepe/pen/KKpKRxj'>JavaScript - Block vs Inline</a> by Raul Garcia
  (<a href='https://codepen.io/rglepe'>@rglepe</a>) on <a href='https://codepen.io'>CodePen</a>.
</iframe>


---

## Block-level Elements

Block-level elements begin a new line on the webpage and, if no width is set, extend the full width of the available horizontal space of its parent element.

Examples of block-level elements are paragraphs or page divisions. Want to give it a try?

We will be working with this CodePen to learn our first block-level HTML tags!

‚ö°Ô∏è Remember to click Edit on CodePen so you can code along and play around

<iframe height="265" style="width: 100%;" scrolling="no" title="HTML Body block Elements" src="https://codepen.io/rglepe/embed/dLZXOQ?height=265&theme-id=default&default-tab=html,result" frameborder="no" allowtransparency="true" allowfullscreen="true">

### Exercise 1: The initial HTML on CodePen
<hr>

In the HTML section of the CodePen you will find the code that is in the body section of an HTML file. CodePen allows you to simplify the code you insert here by adding in another layer some metadata, doctype information and stuff that is usually in the head section of an HTML file.

If you take a look at CodePen, you can find a tab for CSS code and another one for JavaScript code. We will not use them for now, but keep in mind the code in these tabs is already linked to the HTML.

In your HTML tab, let‚Äôs add a new paragraph to explain a little bit about our Breakfast Place.

We will use the tag `<p>` for paragraph and we‚Äôll insert it in the CodePen replacing the comment:

`<!-- Insert paragraph here -->`

You can copy and paste this text:

```html
<p>Our commitment is to use impeccable sourcing and quality ingredients to help 
  you code.An ongoing collaboration between the classroom staff and the development
   team allow us to iterate our content and give our students the coding 'fruits and
    vegetables' -mainly made of JavaScript- that they need to grow as a healthy 
    developer.</p>
```
Easy, right?

---

### Paragraphs

The HTML `<p>` element represents a paragraph of text. Paragraphs are blocks of text separated from adjacent blocks by vertical blank space and/or first-line indentation.

---


### Preformated text

The `<pre>` element represents preformatted text. Text within this element is typically displayed in a non-proportional (‚Äúmonospace‚Äù) font exactly as it is laid out in the file.

This is an example of preformatted text. If you look closer, you will discover that the code in this platform is preformatted text üòÉ

<pre>This is a preformatted text</pre>

---

### Headings

Heading elements have six levels of document headings (titles): `<h1>` is the most important and `<h6>` is the least. A title briefly describes the topic of the section it introduces.

The following code shows all the heading levels, in use.

```html
<h1>Heading level 1</h1>
<h2>Heading level 2</h2>
<h3>Heading level 3</h3>
<h4>Heading level 4</h4>
<h5>Heading level 5</h5>
<h6>Heading level 6</h6>
```

Copy them in your CodePen to see its output!

---

### Lists

__Ordered List__: `<ol>` element represents an ordered list of items. Each list item is numbered.

__Unordered List__: `<ul>` element represents a list of items too. However, the order of items is not relevant.

Here‚Äôs a good trick to determine which one to use: try changing the order of the list items; if the meaning is changed, the `<ol>` element should be used, else the `<ul>` is adequate.

There is no limitation to the depth and overlap of lists defined with the `<ol>` and `<ul>` elements.

### List Items

Ordered and unordered lists both have elements within them. These elements are declared as `<li>` elements.

This would be an example of code for an ordered list:

```html
<ol>
  <li>first item</li>
  <li>second item</li>
  <li>third item</li>
</ol>
```

---

### Tables

table, tr, td, tfoot, thead

The `<table>` tag

This element is used to express information in a two-dimensional data table. It requires several other elements inside to make sense.

The HTML element table row `<tr>` defines a row of cells in a table. If the element inside a row defines a header, we should use the `<th>` (table header), otherwise we should use the `<td>` (table data).

---

This would be a simple example of a table:

```html
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Name</th>
    <th>Bootcamp</th>
    <th>City</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Jose Perez</td>
    <td>FullStack WebDev</td>
    <td>Madrid</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Michael Smith</td>
    <td>FrontEnd WebDev</td>
    <td>Barcelona</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Ariel Quinones</td>
    <td>MasterChef WebDev</td>
    <td>Miami</td>
  </tr>
</table>
```
---

And this is its output:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Name</th>
    <th>Bootcamp</th>
    <th>City</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Jose Perez</td>
    <td>FullStack WebDev</td>
    <td>Madrid</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Michael Smith</td>
    <td>FrontEnd WebDev</td>
    <td>Barcelona</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Ariel Quinones</td>
    <td>MasterChef WebDev</td>
    <td>Miami</td>
  </tr>
</table>

---

### Forms

The `<form>` element is a section that allows the user to input information in the page. The `<form>` elements holds __inputs__, __radio buttons__, __select boxes__, etc. Usually we will send this information to a web server, although we will learn how to access the user input from JavaScript as well.

The form element requires two very important attributes to work properly. Those are the __action__ and __method__ attributes.

Remember forms are elements created to allow users to send information to the website‚Äôs server. When a user does this, it‚Äôs known as a post (as in the user posts information).

#### Action
This attribute sets the URI to the program that processes the form information. In other words, it tells the form where to send the information.

#### Method
This attribute sets the HTTP method that the browser uses to submit the form. We will learn just the post method for now.

The post method corresponds to the HTTP POST method. This method sends the data inserted in the form to the server.

---

An example of a simple form with a post request would be:

    <form action="" method="post">
      <label for="name">Name:</label>
      <input id="name" type="text">
      <button type="submit">Save</button>
    </form>

#### Fieldset

The HTML `<fieldset>` element is used to group several controls as well as labels (`<label>`) within a web form.

We would need to group elements inside a form for different reasons: style purposes, organization and web accessibility features.

This is a form example with fieldset and label. It only includes one clickable element.

```html
<form action="/users" method="post">
  <fieldset>
    <input type="radio" id="radio"> <label for="radio">Click me</label>
  </fieldset>
</form>
```
---


### Exercise 2
<hr>
Let‚Äôs practice!
We already used the `<p>` tag, but let‚Äôs add more semantic content.

Use `<pre>` tag to add a funny message asking our customers to code and enjoy

    <pre>
      Code everyday and enjoy your coffee every morning
    </pre>
---
### Exercise 2 (cont.)
<hr>

Let‚Äôs create a menu, using our fancy lists, to let them now what kinds of coffee we serve.

    <h3>Our food</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Our coffee
        <ol>
          <li>Cafe Latte</li>
          <li>Americano</li>
          <li>Capuccino</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        Our teas
        <ol>
          <li>Earl Grey</li>
          <li>English Breakfast</li>
          <li>Herb Tea</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ul>
Insert the code in your CodePen replacing this comment:

`<!-- Insert your menu here -->`

---
### Exercise 2 (cont.)
<hr>
Let‚Äôs create a form for reservations. But for now, we will leave it empty. We will fill it up with inline elements. We won‚Äôt add the method or action for now.

<!-- Insert your reservations form here -->

Copy and paste this code

    <h3>Reservations here!</h3>
    <form>

    </form>

We will let you work with tables on your own. Try to change the menu list and transform it into a table. 

---

### Inline elements

Inline elements __flow like text__. They don‚Äôt start a new line and they are shown right next to the previous element without clearing previous content.

Let‚Äôs improve our HTML by using a couple new tags. Let‚Äôs take a look at them.

#### Emphasizing the text

Let‚Äôs try emphasizing text. We will use em tag to do it. We will emphasize the words ‚Äúimpeccable‚Äù and ‚Äúquality‚Äù by wrapping them into _em_ tags:

    ... commitment is to use `<em>`impeccable`</em>` sourcing
    and `<em>`quality`</em>` ingredients...

Modify the code on CodePen to see the result.

---
_When to use `<i>` and when to use `<em>`?_

Although the visible result of the text style is that the word ‚ÄòJavaScript‚Äô is in italic, there‚Äôs a difference between the em tag, to emphasize stress. According to MDN:

It is often confusing to new developers why there are so many elements to express emphasis on text. `<i>` and `<em>` are perhaps one of the most common. Why use `<em></em>` vs `<i></i>`? They produce exactly the same result, right?

Not exactly. The visual result is, by default, the same - both tags render their content in italics. But the semantic meaning is different.

An example for `<em>` could be: ‚ÄúJust do it already!‚Äù, or: ‚ÄúWe had to do something about it‚Äù. A person or software reading the text would pronounce the words in italics with an emphasis.

An example for `<i>` could be: ‚ÄúThe Queen Mary sailed last night‚Äù. Here, there is no added emphasis or importance on the word ‚ÄúQueen Mary‚Äù. It is merely indicated that the object in question is not a queen named Mary, but a ship named Queen Mary . Another example for `<i>` could be: ‚ÄúThe word the is an article‚Äù.

---

#### Strong
It gives text strong importance, and is typically displayed in __bold__.

Displaying Time/Dates
It is intended to be used presenting dates and times in a machine readable format. A very common attribute is `<datetime>`, which indicates the time and date of the element and must be a valid date with an optional time string to be parsed.

#### Links (Anchors)
`<a>` It defines a hyperlink to a location on the same page or any other page on the Web. Usually followed by ‚Äòhref‚Äô attribute.`<a href = "http://www.example.com">`

#### Break
`<br>` produces a line break in text (carriage-return) and it has no closure.

#### Images
`<img>` defines an image. Is followed by the ‚Äòsrc‚Äô attribute and it is mandatory to add the image URL.

    <img src = "http://www.example.com">

---

#### Scripts

`<script>` is used to embed or reference an executable script within an HTML file.

#### Spans
`<span>` is a generic inline container for phrasing content, which does not inherently represent anything. It can be used to group elements for styling purposes. It should be used only when no other semantic element is appropriate. Not recommended.

#### Buttons

`<button>` represents a <button>clickable</button> button.

#### Inputs

It is used to create interactive controls for web-based forms in order to accept data from the user. How it works varies considerably depending on the value of its type attribute.

---

#### Labels
It represents a caption for an item in a user interface. It can be associated with a control either by placing the control element inside the `<label>` element, or by using the for attribute. One input can be associated with multiple labels.

#### Selects

The HTML `<select>` element represents a control that presents a menu of options. The options within the menu are represented by `<option>` elements, which can be grouped by `<optgroup>` elements.

#### Textarea

It represents a multi-line plain-text editing control. You can indicate the size by specifying number of column and rows.

---
### Exercise 3
<hr>

Let‚Äôs practice!
We already used the `<em>` tag, but let‚Äôs add more semantic content.

Use `<strong>` tag to highlight the words ‚Äòimpeccable‚Äô and ‚Äòquality‚Äô:

...Our commitment is to use `<strong>`impeccable`</strong>` sourcing
and `<strong>`quality`</strong>`...

Let‚Äôs add a __‚ÄòContact Us‚Äô link__ in the footer section. This will open our user‚Äôs default email application and send an email to our staff:

    ...

    <a href="mailto:breakfast@ironhack.com">Contact Us</a>

    </footer>
    ...

---
### Exercise 3 (cont.)
<hr>
Every restaurant has a schedule. Let‚Äôs display our hours:

    ...
      <p>We are open every day of the week from <time>8:00</time> to <time>22:00</time></p>
  
      <footer>
    ...

If you don‚Äôt see any special change in your time, it‚Äôs because what we are doing here is telling the computer this is a time element. Just that. We could later style every time element with CSS. For now it‚Äôs a readable format for computers.

---
### Exercise 3 (cont.)
<hr>
Customers should be able to make reservations, let‚Äôs create some fields. For now, we won‚Äôt save their information, but let‚Äôs create the space for them to input their reservation information. We will use the form element we created before

    ...
    <label>

    Reservation for:
    `   <input type="text" name="name" value="Your name" />`

    </label>

    <label>
        Meal:
        <select name="meal">
            <option value="breakfast">Breakfast</option>
            <option value="tea-time">Tea Time</option>
        </select>
    </label>
    <label>
        How many people?
        <select name="how-many">
            <option value="1">1</option>
            <option value="2">2</option>
            <option value="3">3</option>
            <option value="4">4</option>
        </select>
    </label>

    <button type="submit">Submit  Reservation</button>

    ...

---
### Exercise 3 (cont.)
<hr>
Pretty cool, huh? Now is your time to play a little bit with the rest of the elements. Insert a span text, change and customize the text. Insert new images and a textarea for customers just in case they have allergies.

For now, keep the script tag out of your playground. We will learn about it later üòÉ

---
### Hidden elements

There is also a third type of element in HTML: those that aren‚Äôt displayed at all. These elements provide information about the page but aren‚Äôt displayed when rendered in a Web browser (as every element of our `<head>` section).

---

### Summary

In this unit, we learned that HTML is a language for creating web pages and applications. Its elements are the building blocks of web pages. Also, we learned that the DOM is a file that contains the elements of an HTML document, their format and the browser state at a specific moment.

Additionally, we learned to use block-level and inline elements. Block-elements begin a new line on the webpage and, if no width is set, they extend the full width of the available horizontal space.
On the contrary, inline elements‚Äô width only extends as far as its tag defines it.
Hidden elements are those that aren‚Äôt displayed at all.

The following elements are ‚Äúblock-level‚Äù:
p, pre, small, h1 to h6, ol, ul, li, table, form, fieldset and many more!

The following elements are ‚Äúinline‚Äù:
em, i, small, strong, time, a, br, img, script, span, button, input, label, select, textarea‚Ä¶
